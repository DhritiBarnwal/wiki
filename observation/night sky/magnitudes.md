## Magnitudes

<br />
[Magnitude](#magnitudes) is essentially a measure of the brightness of an object. It doesn't have any units of measurement. The lower the [magnitude](#magnitudes), the brighter the object. The [magnitude](#magnitudes) scale is logarithmic in nature, i.e., a difference of 1 [magnitude](#magnitudes) corresponds to a difference of ~2.5 times in brightness.

The scale was originally invented by the Alexandrian astronomer, Ptolemy, where he classified the objects on a six-point scale. In the northern hemisphere, Vega is one of the brightest stars, earning itself a [magnitude](#magnitudes) of 0. The other stars were classified with Vega as reference.

More recently, the modern logarithmic magnitude scale was adopted and the Sun was placed at an [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) of approximately -27. The rest of the celestial bodies (and satellites like the ISS) followed suit.

### Apparent Magnitude

[Apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) is the most widely used type of [magnitude](#magnitudes). If you have a reference object, whose [magnitude](#magnitudes) is fixed (or known), the [magnitude](#magnitudes) of any other object can be very easily calculated using the following formula:

$$
\begin{equation}
  m_1 - m_{ref} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F_1}{F_{ref}} \right)
\end{equation}
$$

where:

- $$m_1$$ = [Apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) of the object you're interested in
- $$F_1$$ = Flux from the object you're interested in
- $$m_{ref}$$ = [Apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) of the reference object
- $$F_{ref}$$ = Flux from the reference object

Note that the flux referred to here is generally known as intensity in physics, which can be measured in units such as watts per square metre ($$Wm^{-2}$$). You can find the [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) of some of the popular objects, arranged in decreasing order, in the following table:

| Object             | [Apparent Magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Sun                | -26.832                                   |
| Full Moon          | -12.90                                    |

| Sirius             | -1.46                                     |

| Betelgeuse         | +0.58                                     |
| Mars               | +0.71                                     |

| Andromeda (M31)    | +3.44                                     |

### Absolute Magnitude

It is a well-known theorum in physics that the intensity is inversely proportional to distance squared. Hence, one can calculate the [absolute magnitude](#absolute-magnitude) of any object if the [apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) and the distance of the object from the observer is known using the following formula:

$$
\begin{equation}
  m - M = 2.5 \log_{10} (d/10)^2 = 5 (\log_{10}d - 1)
\end{equation}
$$

where:

- $$M$$ = [Absolute magnitude](#absolute-magnitude) of the object you're interested in
- $$m$$ = [Apparent magnitude](#apparent-magnitude) of the object you're interested in
- $$d$$ = Distance of the object you're interested in from you
